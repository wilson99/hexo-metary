#### **活动的目标，自管理团队**

#### **The 3 legs of empirical process**
* Transparency -> 透明
* Inspection -> 检测
* Adaptation -> 调整

#### **Agile Values**
* Individuals and interactions	OVER	processes and tools	-> 个体和交互	高于	流程和工具
* Working software	OVER	comprehensive documentation -> 可工作的软件	高于	详尽的文档
* Customer collaboration	OVER	contract nogotiation -> 客户协作	高于	合同谈判
* Responding to changes	OVER	following a plan -> 相应变化	高于	遵守变化

#### **3 Roles**
* Development Team -> 小团队，跨职能，5-9人；自管理；Full Time在一起
* Product Owner -> 要有财务权，唯一得到授权的人，ROI(Return of investment)投资回报率
* ScrumMaster

#### **3 Artifacts**
* Product Backlog
* Sprint Backlog
* Increment

#### **5 Events**
* Sprint -> Duration: 1-4 weeks
* Sprint Planning -> 2h/week: What will be done, How will it be done
* Daily Scrum -> 15 min: Done yesterday, Will Done today, Blocking Issue
* Sprint Review -> 1h/week: all stakeholders and interested parties
* Sprint Retrospective -> 45 min/week: what start, what stop, what keep doing

#### **5 Values**
* Courage
* Openness
* Focus
* Commitment
* Respect

#### 注：
* 迭代成功率不能用来考核，应该看功能交付率
* 燃尽图，燃起图
* Estimate is never accurate, we like Relative Estimation better
* 敏捷<>更快的交付，反而更多时间，人力，成本，敏捷更慢，更多回归测试，好处是在最短的时间交付最大价值，随时可以变
* PO, SM都可以带多个团队，团队组员不能跨团队
* 领功能在迭代计划会议之后

#### Agile Principles
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous deliver of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Delivery working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of converying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to tecnical excellence and good design enhaces agility.
10. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amout of work not done - is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts it behavior accordingly.
